# Subconscious-Vision-Board-Sample
<b>App description:</b><br>
This app allows users to add images from Photos, delete and re-arrange them by using long press gesture recognizer and play them at a rapid speed. I’ve implemented local notifications and stored them in UserDefaults to help users achieve their life goals. I also designed the app and its user experience.
